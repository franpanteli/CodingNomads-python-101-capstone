# CodingNomads-python-101-capstone
### About This Repository
I independently completed CodingNomad’s [Python 101 - Introduction to Python](https://codingnomads.com/course/python-programming-101) certification to invest in my Python skills. This course is the first of ten in the [CodingNomads Python Web Development Career Track](https://codingnomads.com/career-track/python-web-development-learn-python-bootcamp). This repository contains my independent problem-solving work, as part of the capstone project in this course. I devised a script for this ([dungeons_and_dragon_game.py](https://github.com/franpanteli/CodingNomads-python-101-capstone/blob/main/dungeons_and_dragon_game.py)). This created a command-line game, where the user would interact with the game world via CLI inputs. The script would first prompt the player for their name and store it for use throughout the game via f strings. The script would next display a welcoming message to the user. They would then be prompted to choose between two doors (left or right). When entering the left room, the player would encounter it empty. When moving into the right room, they would discover a sword that could be picked up. This was implemented by using the `input()` method, and the status of the sword pick up was tracked by using a boolean value. The user would next be provided the option of changing rooms, in which case they may have encountered a dragon and won or lost the game depending on whether the sword had been picked up. This code was written into the project [dungeons_and_dragon_game.py](https://github.com/franpanteli/CodingNomads-python-101-capstone/blob/main/dungeons_and_dragon_game.py) file, which was submitted to mark the successful completion of the capstone project in the certification. This enabled me to invest in my game design, if block writing skills and input management skills with Python, to further invest in my independent learning.
