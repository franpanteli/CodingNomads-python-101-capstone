# CodingNomads-python-101-capstone
### About This Repository
I independently completed CodingNomad’s [Python 101 - Introduction to Python](https://codingnomads.com/course/python-programming-101) certification, to invest in my Python skills. This course is the first of ten in the [Python Web Development Career Track](https://codingnomads.com/career-track/python-web-development-learn-python-bootcamp) with CodingNomads. This repository contains my independent problem-solving work, as part of the capstone project in this course. I devised a script for this ([dungeons_and_dragon_game.py](https://github.com/franpanteli/CodingNomads-python-101-capstone/blob/main/dungeons_and_dragon_game.py)). This created a command-line game, where the user would interact with the game world via CLI text inputs. This would prompt the player for their game and store it for later use with f strings. This script would next display a welcoming message to the user. They would then be prompted by the script to choose between two doors (left or right). When entering the left room, the player would encounter an empty room. When moving into the right room, they would encounter a sword that could be picked up. This was implemented by using the `input()` method, and its status tracked by using a boolean value. The user would next be provided the option of changing position, in which case they may encounter a dragon and win or lose the game depending on whether the sword had been picked up. This code was written into the project [dungeons_and_dragon_game.py](https://github.com/franpanteli/CodingNomads-python-101-capstone/blob/main/dungeons_and_dragon_game.py) file, which was submitted to mark the successful completion of the capstone project in the certification. This enabled me to invest in my game design, if block creation and input-building skills with Python, to further invest in my independent learning.
