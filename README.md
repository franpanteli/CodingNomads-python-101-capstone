### About This Repository
I independently completed freeCodeCamp’s [Scientific Computing](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/) with Python certification, to invest in my scientific computing skills with Python. This repository contains my independent problem-solving work, as part of the thirteenth project in this curriculum. I devised a script for this ([Budget-App.py](https://github.com/franpanteli/Budget-App-Python-Project/blob/main/Budget-App.py)). This first created the`Category` class for budget tracking and secondly a bar chart plotting function, to track relative expenditures across each of these categories. When defining the `Category` class, numerous spending categories were first created. Each of these was assigned a ledger, which contained transaction details. Methods were next defined for this which allowed deposit, withdrawal, transfer and balance inquiries to be executed on the category. The bar chart plotting function (`create_spend_chart`) was next written, to generate a bar chart based on the relative expenditures within each budget category. This function took a list of category objects created with the previously defined `Category` class, to generate these bar plots. The requirements for this class and plotting function were exported as a PDF from the project UI and [annotated with in depth problem solving approaches](https://github.com/franpanteli/Budget-App-Python-Project/blob/main/Task%20Challenge%20Notes.pdf). These were written into Python in the project [Budget-App.py](https://github.com/franpanteli/Budget-App-Python-Project/blob/main/Budget-App.py) file, which was submitted to mark the successful completion of the thirteenth project in the certification. This enabled me to invest in my class and function defining skills with Python, to further invest in my independent learning.
