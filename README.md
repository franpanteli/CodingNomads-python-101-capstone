# CodingNomads-python-101-capstone
### About This Repository
I independently completed CodingNomad’s [Python 101 - Introduction to Python](https://codingnomads.com/course/python-programming-101) certification, to invest in my Python skills. This course is the first of ten in the [Python Web Development Career Track](https://codingnomads.com/career-track/python-web-development-learn-python-bootcamp) with CodingNomads. This repository contains my independent problem-solving work, as part of the capstone project in this course. 

I devised a script for this ([dungeons_and_dragon_game.py](https://github.com/franpanteli/CodingNomads-python-101-capstone/blob/main/dungeons_and_dragon_game.py)). 

This first created a simple command-line role-playing game (RPG), where the player interacts with the game world through text inputs. The initial step was to prompt the player for their name, storing it for use throughout the game. A welcoming message was then displayed, introducing the player to the world. Next, the game logic was built around a choice mechanic, where the player selects between two doors. If the left door is chosen, the player finds an empty room, while choosing the right door introduces a dragon encounter. A branching interaction was then defined, allowing the player to either return to the previous room or continue forward. In the empty room branch, the player is given the opportunity to look around, where they discover a sword. The option to pick up the sword was implemented, storing this decision for later use. The sword acts as a key condition in determining the outcome of the dragon encounter. When facing the dragon, the player’s fate depends on whether they have collected the sword. If they did, they are able to fight and defeat the dragon, winning the game. If not, they are defenseless and lose the encounter. The logic of the game relies on boolean checks and string inputs to track the player’s decisions across multiple stages of the game loop. This progression demonstrates fundamental RPG mechanics—exploration, choice, item collection, and combat resolution—implemented in a minimal, text-based environment.


This code was written into the project [dungeons_and_dragon_game.py](https://github.com/franpanteli/CodingNomads-python-101-capstone/blob/main/dungeons_and_dragon_game.py) file, which was submitted to mark the successful completion of the capstone project in the certification. This enabled me to invest in my game design, if block creation and input-building skills with Python, to further invest in my independent learning.
